The issue was resolved by verifying the Tailwind CSS build process.  Ensure that your build process correctly includes and processes your Tailwind CSS configuration and that the output CSS is correctly linked in your production HTML. Double check that your production environment has the necessary node modules for Tailwind, and also that the correct paths are defined in your `tailwind.config.js`.
